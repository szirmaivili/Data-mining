# Data-mining

This repository contains 5 mini-projects from my data mining course. The main purpose is to showcase my current knowledge of data mining and preprocessing. 
Comments and instructions are in Hungarian within the codes, but here is a brief summary of each project:

Project_2: Pandas library and data preprocessing.
Project_3: Encoding, scaling, and data representation.
Project_4: Modelling, cross-validation, classification, confusion matrix and metrics, logistic regression.
Project_5: Fine-tuning, random forest, hyperparameter optimization, performance measurement (with metrics derived from the confusion matrix), 
           ROC-curve, ROC-AUC for performance evaluation, neural network.
Project_6: Gradient boosting, unbalanced datasets, over- and undersampling, early stopping.

That concludes the curriculum in a nutshell. Further information can be found within the codes themselves.
